Risk Analysis in Banking

Analyzing the Risk Analytics in Banking dataset to predict whether a customer applying for a loan will default: We're examining if an individual has late payments exceeding X days in at least one of the first Y installments of the loan in our sample. In all other cases, when payments are made on time, we aim to discern the impact of various attributes provided in the dataset.
